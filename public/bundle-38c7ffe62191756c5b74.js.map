This seems simple but it becomes needlessly complex when you have dispatches within dispatches and subscribers get called from within subscribers. I add the following functions:\n *\n * subscribeToState(function (lastState, currentState) { // compare last tree to current tree })\n * subscribeToKey('someBranch', function (lastBranch, currentBranch) { // only gets fired when that particular key gets changed })\n * subscribeToEvent('SOME_EVENT', function (lastTree, currentTree) { // called when the event is dispatched })\n *\n * Each function returns an unsubscribe function.\n * There is also a subscribeToXXXOnce function which does the same thing but is only called once.\n *\n * Calling subscribers from within subscribers can be a source of unnecessary infinite recursion, so there is a mutex feature. Since Redux containers are passed in only the `dispatch` function, I decided to make a `dispatch.mutexDispatch` that can be called if you want to dispatch an event that only calls the reducers, and skips over the subscribers. Subscriptions can be tricky in Redux and also costly, so if you have an event you want to dispatch only for the direct effect on the state tree from the reducers, you can use `dispatch.mutexDispatch`\n */\n\nimport { combineReducers, createStore } from 'redux';\nimport Reducer from '../../dist/common/reducer';\nimport reducers from './reducers';\nimport { loadState, saveSelectedAccount, saveState } from '../lib/localStorage';\nimport throttle from '../../dist/common/throttle';\nimport BigRational from 'big-rational';\nimport BigNumber from 'big-number';\nimport isAllowed from '../lib/is-allowed';\nimport { rowEnterDuration } from '../fixtures';\nimport difference from 'lodash/difference';\nimport differenceBy from 'lodash/differenceBy';\nimport intersectionBy from 'lodash/intersectionBy';\nimport injectSubscribe from 'redux-advanced-subscribe';\nimport sortBy from 'lodash/sortBy';\nimport clone from 'clone';\nimport { parse } from 'path';\n\nconst { keys, assign } = Object;\nconst { isArray } = Array;\n\nconst persistedState = loadState();\n\nconst defaultToken = {\n  symbol: 'N/A',\n  name: 'N/A',\n  unselected: true\n};\n\nlet { log } = console;\n\nlog = log.bind(console);\n\n/* RAY explain what all that mutex stuff is for.\n * Also the subscribeToKey and subscribeToEvent and subscribeToState are your own extensions to Redux, right?\n * Please eplain what they do.
